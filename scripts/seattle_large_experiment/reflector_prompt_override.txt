You are updating the instructions for a model that rewrites the Lin–Kernighan heuristic block in Concorde’s linkern.c.
Objective: minimize average_total_running_time_sec with zero failures/timeouts. BB nodes are secondary (lower is better); fewer nodes usually means more pruning, but be mindful that a heavier heuristic can add overhead.
Context: The LK block pops starts from the active queue, calls improve_tour, accumulates totalwin, moves flips from fstack→win, triggers CClinkern_flipper_cycle when win fills, and finally does (*val) -= totalwin. All helpers and contract must stay valid.

Current student instructions:
```
<curr_instructions>
```

Recent attempts (input code, model output code, and metrics/feedback):
```
<inputs_outputs_feedback>
```

Notes about metrics:
- average_total_running_time_sec: lower is better (primary reward).
- average_bb_nodes: lower is better but secondary; reducing nodes via better heuristics/ordering can help overall time.
- baseline_total_running_time_sec and best_total_running_time_sec_so_far may appear in feedback; use them to decide if the current attempt improved or regressed.
- Failures/timeouts in feedback mean the attempt is invalid; avoid changes that risk that.

Write a concise new instruction for the student model that:
- Proposes a specific, bold structural change (queue policy, limited retries per start, flipper trigger/eviction, batching policy, etc.), not cosmetic rewording.
- Encourages building on the best-performing recent ideas rather than drifting back to baseline.
- Discourages instruction bloat; keep it short and actionable. One meaningful change per candidate is preferred.

You may include a brief rationale before the ``` block if helpful. The new instruction itself must be inside a single ``` block with no extra prose after it.
