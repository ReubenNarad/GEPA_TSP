Seattle travel-time instances (n≈400) from the city road network.

Facts for reflection:
- Edge weights are travel times in seconds on the road graph (non-Euclidean).
- No geometric shortcuts; path costs come from shortest paths on the network.
- Goal: minimize average total running time with zero failures/timeouts; BB nodes are secondary (fewer nodes usually correlates with faster solves, but a more complex heuristic can add overhead).

Guidance for the reflector:
- Favor bold, structural changes that have worked: smarter start selection/queuing, limited extra retries per start, batching/eviction policies for fstack→win, and smarter flipper-cycle triggering.
- Encourage building on best-performing recent candidates (reuse ideas that yielded the lowest total time).
- Discourage cosmetic prompt bloat; keep instructions concise and focused on actionable algorithm changes. Give the student room to make one meaningful change per candidate.
